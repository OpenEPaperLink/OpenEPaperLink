## How to make a flasher cable

- choose between the small pcb (v1.1) or the big pcb (v1.3). The big PCB is a bit more comfortable to hold
- download the gerber files and send them to jlcpcb, or find some other way to produce them
- print the easyjig connector, preferrably in nylon. If you cannot print nylon, jlcpcb does a good job with their 3d print sevice. Printing the 'mal' (=jig) is optional but helps a lot in positioning the pogo pins during soldering. Make sure to print it in nylon as well. Printing the cap is totally optional, it can be printed in any material
- order the components. You don't really need the button, resistor and led, but these parts are important:

	- 2x5 pin 1.27 pitch smd header (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003815207542.html, make sure you select 'type 2' and '2x5 pin')
	- ribbon cable with connectors, 10 pin, 1.27 pitch (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003375672088.html, make sure you select '2x5 10P')
	- P75-B1 pogo pins (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32944964110.html)
